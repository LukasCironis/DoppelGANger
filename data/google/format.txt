The measurements are the following in order:

CPU_rate
canonical_memory_usage
assigned_memory_usage
unmapped_page_cache
total_page_cache
maximum_memory_usage
local_disk_space_usage
maximum_CPU_rate
sampled_CPU_usage

The metadata is end_event_type, where the four choices correspond to EVICT, FAIL, FINISH, KILL in order.
